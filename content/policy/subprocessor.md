## Subprocessors and Cookies

Effective date: **May 27, 2021**

bintoca provides a great deal of transparency regarding how we use your data, how we collect your data, and with whom we share your data. To that end, we provide this page, which details [our subprocessors](#bintoca-subprocessors), and how we use [cookies](#cookies-on-bintoca).

### bintoca Subprocessors

When we share your information with third party subprocessors, such as our vendors and service providers, we remain responsible for it. We work very hard to maintain your trust when we bring on new vendors, and we require all vendors to enter into data protection agreements with us that restrict their processing of Users' Personal Information (as defined in the [Privacy Policy](privacy)).

| Name of Subprocessor | Description of Processing | Location of Processing | Corporate Location
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| AWS Amazon | Data hosting | United States | United States |
| Cloudflare | Network services | United States | United States |
| Google Apps | Internal company infrastructure | United States | United States |
| Stripe | Payment provider | United States | United States |

When we bring on a new subprocessor who handles our Users' Personal Information, or remove a subprocessor, or we change how we use a subprocessor, we will update this page. If you have questions or concerns about a new subprocessor, we'd be happy to help. Please contact us via {% data variables.contact.contact_privacy %}.
