## Copyright Policy

We take notices of potential copyright infringement seriously. If a user or other party has alleged that
            material on the bintoca website is infringing a copyright of such party or another third-party, the notice
            should be forwarded immediately to [support@bintoca.com](mailto:support@bintoca.com) who will
            work with legal counsel to resolve the dispute. If legal determines the notice satisfies all requirements
            under the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act, then access to the allegedly infringing material
            must be promptly removed or disabled. We will then make a good faith effort to give notice of the claimed
            infringement to the community.

### How to Report Infringement
We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. If you believe any code or other
            materials available through the Service violates a copyright held by you and you would like to submit a
            notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other similar international law, you can submit a
            notice to our agent for service of notice at: [support@bintoca.com](mailto:support@bintoca.com)

Please make sure your notice meets the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requirements.

Please note that a copy of each legal notice we receive is also sent to [Lumen Database](https://lumendatabase.org/)
for publication (with any user's personal information removed).

### How bintoca Responds to Notices

If the posting user objects to removal of the material, such user may file a counter notice. If we receive a
            counter notice from such user meeting the requirements of the DMCA, we will use good faith efforts to notify
            the complainant of such counter notice and reinstate access to the material within 10-14 business days
            unless the complainant notifies us that it has filed a lawsuit against the allegedly infringing user. If we
            do not receive a counter notice from such user within 10 business days of giving notice of the claimed
            infringement, we reserve the right to permanently delete the material at issue.

Note, bintoca cannot provide legal advice to users (whether making a complaint or defending against a
            complaint), and we should ask users with legal questions to seek an attorney.
