We may use such aggregated, non-personally identifying information for research purposes and to operate, analyze, improve, and optimize our Website and Service.

### How we share the information we collect

We may share your User Personal Information with third parties under one of the following circumstances:

#### With your consent
We share your User Personal Information, if you consent, after letting you know what information will be shared, with whom, and why. For example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application Developer to provide you with services. Additionally, you may direct us through your actions on bintoca to share your User Personal Information. For example, if you join an Organization, you indicate your willingness to provide the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization’s access log.

#### With service providers
We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Policy by signing data protection agreements or making similar commitments. Our service providers perform payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, security, and other similar services. While bintoca processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union. If you would like to know who our service providers are, please see our page on [Subprocessors](subprocessor).

#### For security purposes
If you are a member of an Organization, bintoca may share your username, [Usage Information](#usage-information), and [Device Information](#device-information) associated with that Organization with an owner and/or administrator of the Organization, to the extent that such information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.

#### For legal disclosure
bintoca strives for transparency in complying with legal process and legal obligations. Unless prevented from doing so by law or court order, or in rare, exigent circumstances, we make a reasonable effort to notify users of any legally compelled or required disclosure of their information. bintoca may disclose User Personal Information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement if required in response to a valid subpoena, court order, search warrant, a similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

#### Change in control or sale
We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition of corporate entities or business units. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our Website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we made in our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service.

#### Aggregate, non-personally identifying information
We share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use bintoca, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.

We **do not** sell your User Personal Information for monetary or other consideration.

Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. While CCPA only covers California residents, we voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to _all_ of our users, not just those who live in California. You can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it [here](california-privacy).

### Storage contents

#### Access to private storage

If your storage is private, you control the access to your Content. If you include User Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, that information may only be accessible to bintoca in accordance with this Privacy Policy. bintoca personnel [do not access private storage content](terms#e-private-storage) except for
- security purposes
- to assist the storage owner with a support matter
- to maintain the integrity of the Service
- to comply with our legal obligations
- if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or
- with your consent.

However, while we do not generally search for content in your storage, we may scan our servers and content to detect certain tokens or security signatures, known active malware, known vulnerabilities in dependencies, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service, such as violent extremist or terrorist content or child exploitation imagery, based on algorithmic fingerprinting techniques (collectively, "automated scanning"). Our Terms of Service provides more details on [private storage](terms#e-private-storage).

Please note, you may choose to disable certain access to your private storage that is enabled by default as part of providing you with the Service.

bintoca will provide notice regarding our access to private storage content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

#### Public storage

If your storage is public, anyone may view its contents. If you include User Personal Information, [Sensitive Personal Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/), or confidential information, such as email addresses or passwords, in your public storage, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.

Please see more about [User Personal Information in public storage](#public-information-on-bintoca).

### Other important information

#### Public information on bintoca

Many of bintoca services and features are public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or storage or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing bintoca information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape bintoca and compile data as well.

Your User Personal Information associated with your content could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of bintoca data. If you do not want your User Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of bintoca data, please do not make your User Personal Information publicly available and be sure to [configure your email address to be private in your user profile](https://bintoca.com/settings).

If you would like to compile bintoca data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding [information usage](terms#5-information-usage-restrictions) and [privacy](terms#6-privacy), and you may only use any public-facing User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it. For example, where a bintoca user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling User Personal Information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from bintoca, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from bintoca or bintoca users.

Similarly, projects on bintoca may include publicly available User Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. If you have a complaint about any User Personal Information on bintoca, please see our section on [resolving complaints](#resolving-complaints).


#### Organizations

You may indicate, through your actions on bintoca, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information. If you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your User Personal Information. When you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see.

Please note, bintoca may share your username, [Usage Information](#usage-information), and [Device Information](#device-information) with the owner(s) of the Organization you are a member of, to the extent that your User Personal Information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.

Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your User Personal Information in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete the User Personal Information stored in the Account.

### Additional services

#### Third party applications

You have the option of enabling or adding third-party applications, known as "Developer Products," to your Account. These Developer Products are not necessary for your use of bintoca. We will share your User Personal Information with third parties when you ask us to, such as by purchasing a Developer Product from the Marketplace; however, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it.

#### bintoca Hosted Sites

If you create a bintoca site that can collect information, it is your responsibility to post a Privacy Policy that accurately describes how you collect, use, and share personal information and other visitor information, and how you comply with applicable data privacy laws, rules, and regulations. Please note that bintoca may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your bintoca site, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service.

#### bintoca applications

You can also add applications from bintoca, or other application and account features, to your Account. These applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information; however, all bintoca applications are subject to this Privacy Policy, and we collect the amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.

### How you can access and control the information we collect

If you're already a bintoca user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by [editing your user profile](https://bintoca.com/settings). You can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, or by contacting [bintoca Support](mailto:support@bintoca.com).

If bintoca processes information about you, such as information [bintoca receives from third parties](#information-we-collect-from-third-parties), and you do not have an account, then you may, subject to applicable law, access, update, alter, delete, or object to the processing of your personal information by contacting [bintoca Support](mailto:support@bintoca.com).

#### Data portability

As a bintoca User, you can always take your data with you.

#### Data retention and deletion of data

Generally, bintoca retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your [user profile](https://bintoca.com/settings). We retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request. You may contact [bintoca Support](mailto:support@bintoca.com) to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.

After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to other Users' storage may remain.

### Our use of cookies and tracking

#### Cookies

bintoca only uses strictly necessary cookies. Cookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors.

We use cookies solely to provide, secure, and improve our service. For example, we use them to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, identify your device for security purposes, analyze your use of our service, compile statistical reports, and provide information for future development of bintoca. We use our own cookies for analytics purposes, but do not use any third-party analytics service providers.

By using our service, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to log in or use our service.

We provide more information about [cookies on bintoca](subprocessor#cookies-on-bintoca) on our [bintoca Subprocessors and Cookies](subprocessor) page that describes the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.

### How bintoca secures your information

bintoca takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information.

bintoca enforces a written security information program. Our program:
- aligns with industry recognized frameworks;
- includes security safeguards reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our Users' data;
- is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of bintoca’s business operations;
- includes incident response and data breach notification processes; and
- complies with applicable information security-related laws and regulations in the geographic regions where bintoca does business.

In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected Users without undue delay.

Transmission of data on bintoca is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS (TLS).

No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### bintoca's global privacy practices

bintoca is the controller responsible for the processing of your personal information in connection with the Service, except (a) with respect to personal information that was added to storage by its contributors, in which case the owner of that storage is the controller and bintoca is the processor (or, if the owner acts as a processor, bintoca will be the subprocessor); or (b) when you and bintoca have entered into a separate agreement that covers data privacy (such as a Data Processing Agreement).

We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy, though our service providers may store and process data outside the United States. However, we understand that we have Users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries.

We provide the same high standard of privacy protection—as described in this Privacy Policy—to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts. Additionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.

In particular:

 - bintoca provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed, specific, and freely given consent at the time of data collection, when we collect your User Personal Information using consent as a basis.
 - We collect only the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary for our purposes, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.
 - We offer you simple methods of accessing, altering, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected, where legally permitted.
 - We provide our Users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access regarding their User Personal Information, and we limit the purpose for processing it. We also provide our Users a method of recourse and enforcement.

### How we communicate with you

We use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, **and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay**. For example, if you contact our Support team with a request, we respond to you via email. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through bintoca. You may manage your communication preferences in your [user profile](https://bintoca.com/settings).

Depending on your [email settings](https://bintoca.com/settings), bintoca may occasionally send notification emails about new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There's an “unsubscribe” link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you. Please note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.

Our emails may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email.

### Resolving complaints

If you have concerns about the way bintoca is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may also email us directly at [support](mailto:support@bintoca.com) with the subject line "Privacy Concerns." We will respond promptly — within 45 days at the latest.

#### Dispute resolution process

In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and bintoca regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. Additionally, if you are a resident of an EU member state, you have the right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

Although most changes are likely to be minor, bintoca may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Policy through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the primary email address specified in your bintoca account. We will also update our [Docs](https://github.com/bintoca/docs) repository, which tracks all changes to this policy.
